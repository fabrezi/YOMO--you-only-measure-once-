# Introduction

YOMO is inspired by architecture of yolo model. The idea is to make a tailor-measuring app which will use machine vision technology to make user's measurement.

The following example is presented:

- Download the YOMO app.
- Take pictures.
- The algorithm will make the measurments.
- Send the data in a pdf file.

This is the high level perspective on the working flow but there are much more details needed to be ironed out.
